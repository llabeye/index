<h1>SPICY</h1>
<body>
	Opened in 2017 on the Upper East Side of a dumpster, this 24-hour bitchfest is the creation of club owner/rabbi Jew Diamond Phillips.
	<br>
	This place has <i>everything</i>.
	<ul>
		<li>Sand worms</li>
		<li>geishas</li>
		<li>rock-eaters</li>
		<li>a seven level course in adult education</li>
		<li>And if you want to relax, you can kick back in your very own subway sleeping bag.</li>
	</ul>
	<b>Subway sleeping bag?</b>
	<br>
	It’s that thing of when you’re on the train, and you sit between two guys in FUBU jackets.
