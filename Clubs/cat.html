	Located in an abandoned whitefish factory in Little Israel…
	<br>
	This place has <i>everything</i>.
	<ul>
		<li>Ghosts</li>
		<li>ghouls</li>
		<li>goblins</li>
		<li><i>MY SON</i></li>
		<li>On the dance floor, you’ll find both guys from Wham! wearing a two-man horse costume. Spoiler alert: They’re both in the back.</li>
	</ul>
	<b>Special guest:</b>
	<br>
	Have you heard of Blacula, the Black Dracula? Well, they have a Jewish Dracula.
	<br>
	<b>What’s his name?</b> <br>
	Sidney Applebaum.
	<br>
	<b>Bonus:</b>
	<br>
	For a healthy snack, hit the bar and have some Fraisins — raisins that look like Frasier! Or try your luck with the Human Piñata.
