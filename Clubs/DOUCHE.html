	Inspired by true events, this former CVS, which became a Chase Bank and then became a CVS again, has a familiar yet troubling feel, like when <i>Larry King</i> would play himself in a movie.
	<br>
	This place has <i>everything</i>.
	<ul>
		<li>desk sets</li>
		<li>key fobs</li>
		<li>kale chips</li>
		<li>Roman J. Israel, Esquire</li>
		<li>Plus, you can play everyone’s favorite party game, <i>The Stranger.</i></li>
	</ul>
	<b><i>The Stranger?</i></b>
	<br>
	Well, it’s that thing when you sit on Billy Joel’s hand until it’s numb, and then you rub yourself with it. 
<br>
<b>Why would I do that?</b>
	So you can pretend it’s Bruce Springsteen’s hand.
