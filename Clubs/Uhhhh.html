<h1>Uhhhhh</h1>

	Located in the middle of the West Side Highway, this bi-curious beach party is the creation of Italian club owner Baloney Danza.
	<br>
	This place has <i>everything</i>.
	<ul>
		<li>Split kicks</li>
		<li>pachucos</li>
		<li>pile after pile of expired lunchables</li>
		<li>Sa Hawaiian cleaning lady who looks like Smokey Robinson</li>
		<li><b>Look who just walked in — is that Natalie Portman?</b> No, it’s an old Irish black man that we call Murphy Brown.</li>
	</ul>
	<b>Bonus:</b>
	<br>If you come this Sunday, you’ll meet 2-year-old Ultimate Fighter Drooly-Lips Jackson. He’s got fists like little empanadas, and he’s my best friend.
