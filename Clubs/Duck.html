<h1>Your Mother and I Are Separating</h1>
<body>
	Donâ€™t be fooled by the charred Red Lobster sign out front; this club <i>is</i>a burned-down Red Lobster.
	<br>
	This place has <i>everything</i>.
	<ul>
		<li>A shake for breakfast</li>
		<li>a shake for lunch</li>
		<li>a sensible dinner</li>
		<li>those shoes that nurses wear</li>
		<li>And you can dance the night away to the sounds of Donald Duck having a Vietnam nightmare.</li>
	</ul>
	<b>What does that sound like?</b>
