<h1>Jelly Bones!</h1>

	Located on the Lower Upper Side, this random home invasion is the creation of legally drunk clothing designer Nick Nolte and Gabana. As you walk in, you’ll be handed a glass of champagne — or is it piss?
	<br>
	This place has <i>everything</i>.
	<ul>
		<li>Slurpies</li>
		<li>mushmouths</li>
		<li>litterbugs</li>
	</ul>
	<b>Bonus:</b>
	<br>
	Don’t worry about security, because it’s guarded by an army of hobo-cops.
	<br>
	<b>Hobo-cops?</b> Homeless Robocops.
